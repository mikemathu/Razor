@*//Strongly typed view file: A view that uses the @model expression*@

@model Product //model object declaration

@*This is an example of a Razor code block, which allows me to include C# statements in a view. The code 
block is opened with @{ and closed with }, and the statements it contains are evaluated when the view is 
rendered.*@
@{
	/*Layout = null*/; //null tells MVC that the view is self-contained and will render all the content required for the client
	
	//Applying Layout
	//Layout = "_BasicLayout"; //Removed after adding the value for the layout property
	ViewBag.Title = "Product Name";
}


	Product Name is:	@Model.Name
